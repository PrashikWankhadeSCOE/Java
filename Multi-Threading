=============================================
//do not do this code
//wrong practice 

class MyThread extends Thread {
        public void run(){
                System.out.println("In run");
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());

        }
        public void start(){                                                    //bcoz of the below reason we dont have to write start method in out class where we definetly have to override the run method otherwise out class will be abstrat class
                System.out.println("In myThreadStart");
        }
}
class Demo{
        public static void main(String []a ){
                MyThread obj = new MyThread();
                obj.start();                                                    // As we have seen when we call the start method the new thred start but here no new tread start becouse it is calling the start method of MyThread class created by us which will not start the tread thats why the call is not made to the run() method in out mythread class

                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
}

Output :
In MYthreadStart
main


================================================
//Creating Multi Thread 
// here we have created 3 threads

class Demo extends Thread{
        public void run(){
                System.out.println("Demo :" + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
}

Output :

Demo :Thread-1

================================================ 2nd Way to create a new Thread

// Creating a new Thread without extending the thread Class
// This method can be used when the client wants to make thread in the child class
// by using Runnable Interface We can create new thread in the child class
// Thread class is in lang package so no need to import any package
// Thread has many constructor one of which is Thread(Runnable r)  So we can give parameter of any class which is child of Runnable interface
// here same out MyThread class is the child of runnable Interface so it can be given to thread constructor as parameter

class MyThread implements Runnable{
        public void run(){
                System.out.println("In run");
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
}
class Demo{
        public static void main(String [] args){

                MyThread obj = new MyThread();
                Thread t = new Thread(obj);                             //
                t.start();

                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
}

OutPut :

main
In run
Thread-0

======================================== Priority  in Thread

class MyThread extends Thread{
        public void run(){
                Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
                System.out.println(t.getPriority());
        }
}
class Demo{
        public static void main(String [] args){
                Thread t = Thread.currentThread();
                System.out.println(t.getPriority());

                MyThread obj = new MyThread();
                obj.start();

                t.setPriority(7);

                MyThread obj1 = new MyThread();
                obj1.start();
        }
}

Output :

5
5
7

================================================ Concurrency methods in Thread
================================================ Sleep method
//We also have used setName() method to change the name of the thread

class MyThread extends Thread{
        public void run(){
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());
        }
}
class ThreadDemo{
        public static void main(String [] args)throws InterruptedException{
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());

                MyThread t = new MyThread();
                t.start();

                Thread.sleep(1000);
                Thread.currentThread().setName("MyThread_Main");

                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread());
        }
}

Output 
Thread[main,5,main]
Thread[Thread-0,5,main]
Thread[MyThread_Main,5,main]

===================================================== join method 
// Join method is used to let other thread do its work before this thread 
// the join method is called by the object and the thread which is created by that object is run before this thread
// if we dont give time in the join method then till the other thread complete its work this thread will stay in reay to rn state

class MyThread extends Thread{
        public void run(){
                for(int i = 0;i<10;i++){
                        System.out.println("In Thread - 0");
                }
        }
}
class ThreadDemo{
        public static void main(String [] args)throws InterruptedException{
                MyThread t = new MyThread();
                t.start();

                t.join();

                for(int i = 0;i<10;i++){
                        System.out.println("In main");
                }

========================================
// from this code we get to understand that this code has given dead condition both code are saying each other to complete first so no code will execute
// so to avoid this condition we have to use join method with some time parameter

class MyThread extends Thread{
        static Thread nmMain= null;
        public void run(){
                try{
                        nmMain.join();
                }catch(InterruptedException ie){

                }catch(NullPointerException ne){

                }
        }
}

=======================================================Yeild method 
//this is same as join method but before updates this was not native method
// so calling this was different but now join method and yeild is nearly same

class MyThread extends Thread{
        public void run(){
                System.out.println(getName());
        }

                t.yield();

                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }

Output
